# Architecture Assessment: Bürokratt RAG-Module

## General Description and Purpose

The **RAG-Module** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Module) provides RAG capabilities for Estonian government AI services.  
The module’s purpose is to:

- Integrate with multiple LLM providers (AWS Bedrock, Azure AI, Google Cloud, OpenAI, Anthropic, or self-hosted open-source models).
- Continuously synchronize with the Local Knowledge Base (LKB).
- Restrict responses to trusted sources only.
- Add citations for transparency.
- May implement a fallback mechanism (such as returning an **“I don’t know”** response) when confidence in the generated answer is low.

The focus is on the government environment.

Source code and documentation can be found on the [RAG-Module GitHub repository](https://github.com/buerokratt/RAG-Module).

## Key Features

- **LLM Provider Management**: Administrators can configure multiple LLM connections and switch between them dynamically (dropdown with cache support).
- **Continuous Sync with LKB**: Last sync time is displayed in the UI.
- **Answer Citations**: Each response is linked to its source.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: If confidence is low, the response will be “I don’t know.”
- **Monitoring and Analytics**:  
  - Langfuse dashboard for API usage, cost, and performance tracking  
  - Grafana Loki logging for production system monitoring

## Architectural Structure

The architecture follows the **Modular RAG** paradigm, where the system consists of separate but coordinated modules.  
It resembles **LEGO blocks**: each component is independent and composable.

## Main Components and Data Flow

### 1. Query Processing
- User query (via UI or API) is parsed, rephrased if needed, and disambiguated.

### 2. Retrieval Module
- User queries are directed to the **vector database (Qdrant)**, which stores embeddings of content sourced from the Local Knowledge Base (LKB).
- Continuous synchronization ensures the vector database is up-to-date with the latest cleaned and structured content from LKB.
- Uses **embeddings + similarity search** to retrieve relevant documents for LLM generation.
> Note: The Local Knowledge Base (LKB) stores the authoritative content, while the vector database (Qdrant) stores embeddings for fast retrieval. They are synchronized but serve distinct purposes.


### 3. Generation Module
- Retrieved data is sent to the selected LLM.
- The LLM generates a response, with citations added.
- Confidence is checked → if low, returns fallback response.

### 4. Monitoring Module
- **Logging** (Grafana Loki).
- **Cost & API usage monitoring** (Langfuse).
- **Alerts** for cost overruns and reliability.

---

## Modularity and Separation of Concerns
- Each client has its own independent LLM connection modules, which avoids monolithic design and ensures isolation between deployments.
- Retrieval, generation, and monitoring are separated → easier testing, updating, and scaling.
- Synchronization handled via separate mechanism (e.g., cron/scheduled task).
- Admin UI is a standalone management component.

---

## Strengths

- **Provider flexibility**: Easy switching between LLMs depending on needs or cost.
- **Citations + fallback mechanism**: Improves transparency and reduces hallucination risk.
- **Observability**: Langfuse, Grafana Loki, and alerts provide a strong foundation for production.
- **Modular architecture**: Easier maintenance and extensibility, avoids monoliths.
- **Regulatory fit and multilingual support**: Designed for government context.

## Risks and Challenges

- **Scaling per client**:
  - Vector index size and query latency may become issues for clients with high query volumes.
  - Each client has its own vector database (Qdrant/OpenSearch), so scaling strategies should be considered per deployment.
  
- **Caching & performance**:
  - Embeddings and query results may require caching to optimize latency.
  - Performance tuning can be done individually for each client instance.

- **Version management**:
  - A/B testing and rollbacks should be handled independently per client deployment to avoid cross-impact.

- **Sync consistency**:
  - Keeping the client’s vector database up-to-date with LKB content may become complex for large or frequently updated knowledge bases.
  - Scheduled tasks/cron jobs should be monitored per client.

- **Security & isolation**:
  - Tenant isolation ensures each client’s data and services are fully separated.
  - Network policies, API keys, and access controls should be enforced per deployment.
  - Kubernetes namespace isolation can help enforce separation.

- **Operational maintenance**:
  - Each client deployment requires its own logging, monitoring, and alerting setup (Grafana, Loki, Langfuse).
  - Backups, migrations, and updates need to be performed per client.
  - Kubernetes facilitates rolling updates, scaling, and rollback per client instance.

## Overall Assessment

**Architecturally**: Strong foundation, follows modern RAG best practices (modularity, observability, provider flexibility).

Each client deployment is fully isolated, with its own backend, frontend, vector database, and admin UI, ensuring no cross-tenant data leakage.

Modular RAG design allows independent upgrades, maintenance, and scaling per client.

**Production-readiness**:

- Suitable for small to medium-scale live usage per client.
- For large-scale live usage, considerations include (While in our context it does not apply, I still added this part in-case there could be such a scenario):
  - **Robust vector database**: Each client has its own Qdrant/OpenSearch instance; scaling strategies may be required for high query volumes.
  - **Caching and latency optimization**: Critical for performance; can be tuned per client instance.
  - **Model lifecycle management**: LLM models, embeddings, and indexing strategies need version control and A/B testing independently for each client.
  - **Security framework**: Tenant isolation ensures that each client’s data and services are separated; API keys and network policies should be enforced per deployment.

**Observability and maintenance**:

- Logging, cost monitoring, and alerting are per-client, simplifying debugging and operational oversight.
- Kubernetes deployments allow easy scaling, rolling updates, and rollback per client.

## Conclusion

The architecture is well-designed and suitable for production, but before **mass adoption**, processes for scaling, security, and model management must addressed.
