## DMR-to-DMR Routing Layer

This section is about how multiple DMR nodes communicate securely and reliably with each other to relay messages across the entire network.

### Implement Trusted DMR-DMR Trust Model

Each DMR node must verify and trust the other DMR nodes it connects with. This trust is based on certificates or other cryptographic proofs, ensuring that only authorized DMRs can join and relay messages.

### Use Federation/Exchange Bindings or Routing Rules

Using RabbitMQ features like federation (connecting separate RabbitMQ brokers) or exchange bindings, messages can be forwarded between DMRs. Routing rules define how messages flow from one node to another based on metadata or message properties.

### Ensure Metadata Validation Persists Across Hops

As a message moves from one DMR to another, the important metadata (like sender ID, permissions, or routing info) must be checked and preserved at every step to maintain trust and proper routing.

### Fault-Tolerant Retry and Delivery Semantics

The system should handle temporary failures gracefully. If a message canâ€™t be delivered on the first try, it should be retried without loss or duplication, ensuring reliable message delivery across the mesh.

In short, this section builds the backbone for secure, trusted, and reliable message forwarding between the DMR nodes themselves.
