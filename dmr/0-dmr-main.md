# DMR

## 1. [Messaging Backbone with RabbitMQ](https://github.com/varmoh/documentation/blob/main/dmr/1-Messaging-backbone-rabbitmq.md)

**Goal:** Set up, configure, and secure RabbitMQ as the core message relay system.

- Provision RabbitMQ clusters or nodes (locally or via cloud)
- Define exchanges, queues, and routing rules
- Enforce secure communication (AMQPS with mTLS)
- Set up message TTLs, DLQs, and audit queues

## 2. [Client-to-DMR Communication](https://github.com/varmoh/documentation/blob/main/dmr/2-client-to-dmr.md)

**Goal:** Enable clients to connect, authenticate, and publish/consume messages securely.

- Implement mTLS authentication for clients
- Design metadata schema (headers/properties) for routing
- Access control policy (who can send to whom)

## 3. [DMR-to-DMR Routing Layer](https://github.com/varmoh/documentation/blob/main/dmr/3-DMR-to-DMR.md)

**Goal:** Enable secure relaying between DMRs using RabbitMQ federation or direct AMQP.

- Implement trusted DMR-DMR trust model
- Use federation/exchange bindings or routing rules
- Ensure metadata validation persists across hops
- Fault-tolerant retry and delivery semantics

## 4. Certificate Management (via CentOps)

**Goal:** Automate certificate generation and distribution from CentOps to clients and DMRs.

- Add certificate config field to CentOps client definition (CENTOPS)
- Integrate cert generation (e.g., via certbot or internal CA) (CENTOPS)
- Certification passing to DMR / RabbitMQ  (Unclear for me)
- Handle rotation, revocation, and trust anchor updates (CENTOPS?)

## 5. [Observability & Monitoring](https://github.com/varmoh/documentation/blob/main/dmr/5-observability-monitoring.md)

**Goal:** Monitor message flows, failures, certificate health, and routing success.

- Integrate RabbitMQ metrics and logs (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Emit structured logs (e.g. sender â†’ recipient, result)
- Visualize topology and message hops (optional traces)
- Log configuration reloads, failed deliveries, and policy violations

## 6. [Policy Management & Enforcement (OPA - OpenPolicyAgent)](https://github.com/varmoh/documentation/blob/main/dmr/6-Policy-management.md)

**Goal:** Define and enforce rules like who can talk to whom and under what scope.

- Write policies in Rego (OPA)
- DMR nodes call OPA to validate message actions
- Live reload of policy decisions without restart
- RabbitMQ plugins or consumers to validate metadata claims
- Drop/reject unauthorized messages

## 7. CentOps Control Plane Integration

**Goal:** Make CentOps the command center for clients, policies, topology, and certs.

- CRUD interface for client info + cert management
- Push config/policy changes to DMRs
- Optional: visual topology editor
- CLI or API for bulk operations

## 8. [Operational Resilience](https://github.com/varmoh/documentation/blob/main/dmr/8-operational-resilience.md)

**Goal:** Handle node failures, recover state, and gracefully rejoin the mesh.

- DMR self-healing on cert loss or restart
- Graceful recovery of RabbitMQ clients
- Network partition handling
- Config validation before applying

## 9. [Security and Hardening](https://github.com/varmoh/documentation/blob/main/dmr/9-Security-hardening.md)

**Goal:** Ensure all paths (client, DMR, CentOps) are secure, audit-logged, and revocable.

- Audit logging and tamper resistance
- mTLS-only comms enforced across all nodes
- Token binding (if used for short-lived access)
- Denylist revocation propagation and enforcement

## Optional & Ideas

### 10A. Debug & Test Tooling

- Simulate message flow across many nodes
- CLI tools to debug certs, policies, queue states

### 10B. [OPA](https://github.com/varmoh/documentation/blob/main/dmr/opa.md)
- Understanding of OPA with DMR
